# wekiwi
Time spent: 9 hours

Tools utilized:
* After effects with Trap code from Red Giant for particle generation
* Media encoder for rendering
* Photoshop for background design
* VSCode for IDE

## Design Process & Insights
The most prevalent theme from wekiwi's branding and mission was that of transparency. I wanted to translate that to customers in an informative and visually appealing way. As such I settled on an animation that demonstrated a transparent visual flow of power from the 'source' to their homes. 

I wanted to focus on creating a positive connotation between the brand and users of wetransfer, focussing on transparency was an easy way to achieve this. One key selling point of wekiwi is the app that allows customers to monitor gas consumption. Presenting this poorly ie 'you constantly use power, and are therefore constantly spending money' would encourage anxiety distress amongst users. I chose to address the money saving aspect through copy given the time constraints.

## Stetch goals

**Optimization**

The final bundle of the project is too large, the video alone is 11 MB which may / will impact UX. I would isolate as follows: 
* Create a static background wallpaper of the cityscape and logo
* Create a static image of the pipe bubbles and transition it across the screen much like the rope in the Netflix - Por Trece advertisement. https://wetransfer.com/wallpaper/540066481. This would still give the impression of movement while being much more performant. 
* Find another way to animate the bubbles coming out of the houses with CSS / SVGs.
This would reduce the bundle size, dramatically decrase load times and allow for more flexibility for mobile designs

Justification for the video:
Given the time frame and scope of the project, creating a video was the simplest and most time-effective solution.

**Copy and Design improvements**

The design as it stands is not sufficient enough to explain the value of Wekiwi without some copy text. I had issues accessing wekiwi api documentation however adding in a mobile-first design with css grid would have solved this. 

Secondly, the design needed more contrast between the transparent nature of wekiwi's offering and that of it's more obscure competitors. Designs such as a more complex network of shielded black pipes, a background 'maze' of sorts would have highlighted this. It would be balance between keeping a simple design, and providing one that told enough of a story. Removing the generic 'bubble' energy particles with gusts of wind, coal icons, or water would have helped solidify the message of trackable power. 

Lastly, there needed to be a tie in between transparency and the monitoring app. This could have been highlighted in the copy text.
